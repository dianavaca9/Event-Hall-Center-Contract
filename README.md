# Event Hall Center Contract

## DESCRIPTION OF MY PROJECT: 
 Contracts are required in order to maintain a fair and smooth process with your clients, as well as end of year tax purposes.
This website will show what a "real life contract" looks like. It is to include pricing, rules and regulations, and an invoice included on the second page. This would be made to help my business grow, and look professional and established.

 *__The contract is to also include what happens if clients are to neglect my establishment, and or break the contract.__*
 The priorities for for this project will be to clearly state and clarify the policies in the contract to rent my event hall center.
 The contract should be 1 page, with clear and conscise wording; 1 page for the invoice.

# IDENTIFY RISKS
- Contract goes over 1 page long
- I reiterate the same verbiage multiple times
- I dont finish my project by deadline of 10/3/35 @11:59p.

# PRIORITIZE RISKS
**ACTUAL RISK = IMPACTxPROBABILITY

I would say my risk factor impact would be  minimal (2) and the probability of it happening is a 50/50 chance (3).

# PLAN FOR RISKS

2x3= **6**

I would tame this by **mitigating** (lessen the risk by reducing its probability). I clearly stated in my scope.md file in the priorities and acceptance crieteria subsections, and this should help to keep me on track as well.

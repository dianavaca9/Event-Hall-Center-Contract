# My Restrospective for Project 3

## What was done well?
Being able to put together a well structured webiste using HTML and CSS, for a propsed contract for a Venue that i wish to invest in the future. 

### What needs to be done better or differently?
Building Project 3 was time consuming. Not hard, just very time consuming overall. Next time i would prepare with more time to work on it, as i felt rushed. 

#### What unexpected risks did we have to deal with?
Linking the pages was my biggest issue, and getting my commited action to show on the live website. After some google search, i was able to determine that you need to clear your cookies, or your google/safaris cache to be able to view your updated website. As for the linking, i had to go back and look at my resources, with no rush to understand the linking between my pages. 

##### How does our project management process need to change to meet future goals? 
I would only say time. Time plays a big role on if this will end up being rushed, or feeling like you cant do it. I definetely had time, but a couple days extra coudld've saved me some stress.

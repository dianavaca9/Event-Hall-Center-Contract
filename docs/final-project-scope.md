Dianas' EVENT HALL CENTER CONTRACT

## **PROJECT PURPOSE**

Event parties are a huge success worldwide. Sometimes the amount of people you are inviting, requires an event venue, as a house can only hold so much people and parking spaces. 

- weddings
- quinceneras
- baptisms
- birthday parties
- religious gatherings
- business events
- etc.

The **project purpose** is to buy an event hall center, and to be able to rent it out if not weekly for business gatherings, then every weekend for big events such as the ones I mentioned. Contracts are required in order to maintain a fair and smooth process wiht your clients, as well as end of year tax purposes.

### **DESCRIPTION**

The description for this business project would consist of:

1. A venue big enough for events. (mention capacity and not to exceed___)
2. Taking into consideration the capacity of people the venue could hold (about 150 is the normal)
3. Contracts with Date of rent, how long venue will be used for etc. Invoices And for the contracts to include rules, and regulations,non-refundable fees, amount rented for, and broken things policy etc. 
4. Security if needed, for those who will be having bar services.
5. Clear and consice contract explaing the policies to the venue


An Event Hall Center would be available to anyone, considering the resquested date is available, signed contract and invoice, and upon receiving a 50% non refundable deposit of full amount. 

#### DESIRED RESULTS

At the beginning when buying a venue, I would have to dig into my own savings to purchase the venu, and remodel anything if needed. As the Event Hall Center gets rented out, it would be paying itself for the next 2-3 years. After that, I would be making 100% profit off of the Event Hall Center. 

The desired results would be to create a "REAL LIFE" contract, for this Event Hall Center, including all policies, rules, regulations, invoices etc. The contract is to also include what happens if clients are to neglect my establishment, and or break the contract.

##### EXCLUSIONS

You will not see a list of vendors added to the project. As any vendors needed for decorations, food or music, will all be on the client. 

###### PRIORITIES

The priorities for this project will be to clearly state and clairfy the policies in the contract to rent an Event Hall Center.
The contract should be 1 full page, with clear and conscise wording, and 1 page for the invoice. 

###### ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA

This is only my scope statement that will help me complete my final project. I need to complete the **FINAL PROJECT** by the day of its due date on OCtober 3rd, 2025 at 11:59 pm.
